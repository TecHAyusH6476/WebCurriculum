# Assignment

## **Level 1: Basic Implementation**

### Question 1

Create a function that takes a name as an argument and returns a closure that logs a greeting with that name to the console.

### Question 2

Create an object with a **name** property and a method that logs the **name** property to the console using **this**. Call the method.

### Question 3

Create a function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns the sum of the numbers. Use **call()** and **apply()** to call the function with two arguments.

### Question 4

Create a function that takes a number as an argument and returns a closure that multiplies a number by the number passed as an argument to the parent function. Use **bind()** to bind the closure to a number.

## **Level 2: Intermediate Implementation**

### Question 1

Create a module that exports a function that takes a string as an argument and logs the string to the console. Import the function in another module and call it.

### Question 2

Create a module that exports a class **Person** with a **name** property and a method that logs the **name** property to the console using **this**. Import the class in another module, create an instance, and call the method.

### Question 3

Create a module that exports a function that takes a number as an argument and returns a closure that adds a number to the number passed as an argument to the parent function. Import the function in another module, bind the closure to a number, and call the closure.

## **Level 3: Advanced Implementation**

### Question 1

Create a module that exports a function that takes an array of numbers as an argument and returns the sum of the numbers. Import the function in another module, use **call()** and **apply()** to call the function with two arguments.

### Question 2

Create a module that exports a function that takes an array of numbers as an argument and returns a closure that multiplies a number by the number passed as an argument to the parent function. Import the function in another module, bind the closure to a number, and call the closure for each element in the array.

### Question 3

Create a module that exports a class **Person** with a **name** property and a method that logs the **name** property to the console using **this**. Create a subclass **Student** that has a **major** property and a method that logs the **major** property to the console using **this**. Import the **Student** class in another module, create an instance, and call the method
